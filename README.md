# Go Code Convention

This is a 100% opinionated code convention for the Go Programming Language by [@unknwon](https://github.com/unknwon). It may or may not be compatible with [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments), or any other guidelines out there. That's fine, that is neither mine nor your problem.

## Notes about v1

The [v1](https://github.com/unknwon/go-code-convention/tree/v1) was originally drafted back in 2015, and majority of the content hasn't been updated since. As of 2021, after another 6 years working with Go, some of aspects already feel outdated for me, especially I've learned more practices by working with amazing people. I would love to have these practices documented so I can reference back.
